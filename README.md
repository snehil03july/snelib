You can use functions for vectors and 3-d calculation.

## documentation:
#### 1. dir_cosines(a,b,c)
Here, you have to enter three co-ordinates of a point to get the direction cosines of the point with respect to orgin.

#### 2. cross_product(a,b)
Here, a and b are two 1X3 arrays representing the 3 components of 2 vectors.

#### 3. dist_points(a,b)
Here, a and b are two 1X3 arrays representing two points.

#### 4. angle_lines(a,b)


#### 5. section(m,n,arr1,arr2,internal)


#### 6. dir_cosines(a,b,c)
